						<h2>Enterprise Mobility Solutions</h2>
						<p>
							In the age of rapid, unprecedented change and convergence, technologies like containers, software defined infrastructure and cloud computing are disrupting and transforming traditional IT.
						</p>
						<p>
							As the enterprise command center for Kubernetes, Rancher centrally manages your on-premise or hybrid clusters to ensure security and accelerate transformation. Rancher is built to address the needs of both the DevOps teams deploying applications with Kubernetes and the IT staff responsible for delivering enterprise-critical services. Businesses that use Rancher see a marked improvement in Kubernetes reliability and adoption over alternative solutions.
						</p>
						<p>
							SUSE supports your SAP solutions running on private, hybrid and public cloud as well as on-premise. It also delivers the container infrastructure for SAP’s most forward-looking solutions including SAP S/4HANA and SAP Data Hub. Maintain your edge moving forward by delivering SAP services faster, more efficiently and with less risk.
						</p>
						<p>
							Delivering nonstop IT means your organization can trust that infrastructure, systems and people will be available whenever they’re needed. Service interruptions can affect your reputation and customer service, making it a business priority to run, fix and adapt your systems without missing a step.
						</p>
						<p>
							CoreQuad Labs delivers high availability IT solutions through converged infrastructure with business-critical Linux and scalable automation. To support your goal of keeping services available at all times, you can replicate application data across multiple clusters to recover faster. And we deliver the power to apply kernel fixes and upgrade systems without interrupting service so you can better respond to changing market conditions, while keeping your system secure.
